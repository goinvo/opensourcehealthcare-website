## It's time we drop the "E" in ~~"Electronic"~~ Medical Record.

## Then let's drop the ~~"Medical Record"~~ part.

## Now we start over.

While there are many good open source EHRs in existence, the HealthOS starts with a fresh canvas by removing constraints and considering what will be possible with future technology.

Pieces of this HealthOS are already being build by talented people all around the world, but without a unified goal. We must come together and leverage the collective power of our open source communities to build software that works for humanity. The following are some projects to tap.

* [Mediflux](https://github.com/CitizenHealth/Mediflux)
* [Standard Health Record](standardhealthrecord.org)
* [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/)
* [hGraph](hgraph.org)
* [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
* [Medoplex](https://github.com/CitizenHealth/Medoplex)

To learn, we've got to feed this OS plenty of health data by connecting wearables, sensors, devices, labs, and hospitals using **[Mediflux](https://github.com/CitizenHealth/Mediflux)**. Using the **[Standard Health Record](standardhealthrecord.org)**, we apply machine learning to the beautiful data we have streaming in by the zettabytes.

Our data is cleaned, organized, and combined with the **[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/)** database to be collaboratively used for citizen science research. Even more, you collect dividends when research companies use your data in trials.

Data should tell a unique story. We should visualize out health in one view using **[hGraph](hgraph.org)**, along with continuous monitoring to be alerted if negative patterns emerge.

When we do need to see a doctor, we utilize  **[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)** to connect directly via video or messaging. When physical visits are necessary, interactions will be personal and efficient, leveraging voice, touch, and gestures --no more mouse or keyboard. With dynamically shared information, both you and your care team collaborate intelligently on healthcare issues to minimize medical errors and optimize treatment plans.

Now that we have patients and providers using the OS, we connect everyone on a decentralized marketplace such as **[Medoplex](https://github.com/CitizenHealth/Medoplex)**. Transactions are executed using trusted smart contracts on a federated blockchain network. Each device is a node storing encrypted health records and staking reputation using the Proof of Health protocol. Fraud is eliminated, prices are rational, and payments are instant.
