# Natural language processing (NLP) software for hospital coding

for 3m

### Problem

CodeRyte wanted to take their “bolted-on” coding service, and transform it into a complete package service to dominate the coding market for hospitals.

### Solution

Starting with a shorter proof of concept period, GoInvo designed a comprehensive service with built-in automation to drastically increase efficiency in hospital coding.

### Results

Memorial Hermann Hospital saw a 200% increase in coding efficiency and productivity.

## Background

#### Glenn Tobin has a vision

Glenn’s company, CodeRyte, had a profitable niche providing coding software to hospitals. But they were seen as a “bolt-on” service, another piece of software in an already complicated process. People liked CodeRyte, but wished they didn’t have to use it. The profits were nice, but it was not the sort of business model to get excited about each morning.
