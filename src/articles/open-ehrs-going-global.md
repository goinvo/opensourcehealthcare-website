### Open source healthcare has global reach.
Creating, updating, and reconciling medical records is one of the most visible areas where technology has shaped healthcare. While most electronic health record (EHR) systems remain proprietary, over 30 countries now use open source EHRs in some capacity.[^1] Founded in a rich legacy of global initiative to meet shared, human needs, successful open source healthcare IT initiatives are not only taking a hold in the United States,[^2] but also spreading to Mexico,[^3] Thailand,[^4] France,[^5] Uganda,[^6] Zambia,[^7] Kenya,[^8] [^9] Canada,[^10] [^11] Germany,[^12] the UK,[^13] Australia,[^13] Haiti,[^14] and many other societies.

### OSCAR McMaster
OSCAR is maintained at McMaster University in Canada and used by over 1,500 physician offices with a 12% market share in the Canadian province of Ontario.[^10] It is also in use in Argentina, Ecuador, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Jamaica. [https://oscar-emr.com](https://oscar-emr.com)

### Medic Mobile
Medic Mobile is an open source mHealth non-profit that trains community health workers (CHWs) to have impact on rural populations. Over 20,000 CHWs use Android-based phones and open source software to track immunizations, disease, antenatal care, and basic health in over 23 countries as of 2018 such as Kenya, Nepal, Uganda, India, and now in the Americas.

### AMPATH Medical Record System
Based on OpenMRS, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) Medical Record System (AMRS) was first deployed at the AMPATH center in Eldoret, a regional capital in Western Kenya, and then expanded to eight other AMPATH sites in Western Kenya.[^8] The AMRS has recorded over 100 million discrete clinical observations from 2.8 million AMPATH visits made by 300,000 enrolled patients, from an eligible population of 2 million patients in the catchment area.
